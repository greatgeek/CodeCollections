# 464. [Can I Win](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-i-win/)

In the "100 game," two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1..10. The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.

What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?

For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers of 1..15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.

Given an integer `maxChoosableInteger` and another integer `desiredTotal`, determine if the first player to move can force a win, assuming both players play optimally.

You can always assume that `maxChoosableInteger` will not be larger than 20 and `desiredTotal` will not be larger than 300.

**Example**

```
Input:
maxChoosableInteger = 10
desiredTotal = 11

Output:
false

Explanation:
No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.
```

## show me the code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canIWin(int maxChoosableInteger, int desiredTotal) {
        if(desiredTotal<=maxChoosableInteger) return true;
        int sum=(1+maxChoosableInteger)*maxChoosableInteger/2;
        if(sum<desiredTotal) return false;
        return process(desiredTotal,maxChoosableInteger,0,new HashMap<>());
    }
    
    public boolean process(int total,int n,int state, 
                           HashMap<Integer,Boolean> map){
        if(map.containsKey(state)) return map.get(state);
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            if((state&(1<<i))!=0) continue;
            // 这里其实利用了 || 或运算的最短路径计算原理,相当于以下代码
            /*
            if(total-i>0){
            	if(!process(total-i,n,state|(1<<i),map)){
            		map.put(state,true);
                	return true;
            	}
            }else{
            	map.put(state,true);
                return true;
            }
            */
            /*
            如果做出了 state|(1<<i) 这个决定输了,则做出 state 这个决定可能会赢
            */
            if(total-i<=0 || !process(total-i,n,state|(1<<i),map)){
                map.put(state,true);
                return true;
            }
        }
        map.put(state,false);
        return false;
    }
}
```

Q: Why we don't have to keep track of the player who's making a move?

A: For the first player to win, the second player cannot win. Hence, we do `!canWin(remain, map, rem -i)`. In other words, if the second player loses, first player wins. This goes on recursively.
