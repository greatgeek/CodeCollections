# 647. Palindromic Substrings

Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string.

The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
```

 

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
```

 

**Note:**

1. The input string length won't exceed 1000.

#### Approach #1: Expand Around Center [Accepted]

**Intuition**

Let `N` be the length of the string. The middle of the palindrome could be in one of `2N - 1` positions: either at letter or between two letters.

For each center, let's count all the palindromes that have this center. Notice that if `[a, b]` is a palindromic interval (meaning `S[a], S[a+1], ..., S[b]` is a palindrome), then `[a+1, b-1]` is one too.

**Algorithm**

For each possible palindrome center, let's expand our candidate palindrome on the interval `[left, right]` as long as we can. The condition for expanding is `left >= 0 and right < N and S[left] == S[right]`. That means we want to count a new palindrome `S[left], S[left+1], ..., S[right]`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countSubstrings(String S) {
        int N = S.length(), ans = 0;
        for (int center = 0; center <= 2*N-1; ++center) {
            int left = center / 2;
            int right = left + center % 2;
            while (left >= 0 && right < N && S.charAt(left) == S.charAt(right)) {
                ans++;
                left--;
                right++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time Complexity: *O*(N^2) where *N* is the length of `S`. Each expansion might do *O*(*N*) work.
- Space Complexity: *O*(1).
