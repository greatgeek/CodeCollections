# Semaphore

"Semaphore is a bowl of marbles" - Professor Stark

1. Semaphore is a bowl of marbles (or locks in this case). If you need a marble, and there are none, you wait. You wait until there is one marble and then you take it. If you **release()**, you will add one marble to the bowl (from thin air). If you **release(100)**, you will add 100 marbles to the bowl (from thin air).
2. With semaphores, you can start out with 1 marble or 0 marbles or 100 marbles. A thread can take marbles(up until it's empty) or put many marbles(out of thin air) at a time.
